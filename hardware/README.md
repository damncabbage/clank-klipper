Notes:

- Pin prefix reference:
  - ! indicates that a reverse polarity should be used (eg. trigger on low instead of high),
  - ^ indicates that a hardware pull-up resistor should be enabled for the pin.
  - If the micro-controller supports pull-down resistors then an input pin may alternatively be preceded by ~.
